Seattle Traffic accident Severity Prediction

Traffic accidents are one of the  most common problems around the globe which contributes a large portion to the yearly mortality rate.It is the pure case of human negligance along machine defectness to give rise to this tragic event.
However if we analyze any aftermaths of a traffic accident,we can always find a pattern (bad weather,unusual traffic,machine defect,driver's negligence).So in this project,I am trying to predict the severity of a trafic accident based on these factors.

The purpose of this project is to minimise the traffic accidents to a significant scale in the long shot.The prediction of the severity of traffic accidents will be beneficial to people in a lot of ways.It will also enable government to develop new policies regarding road safety.
